CHAPTER 1: Introduction
1.1 Introduction:
One day I was researching on the internet for an idea for my project and found an article about chat applications.
According to that article “80% of adults aged 19-64 and 91% of teens aged 13-18 uses chat app”. The reasons people use chat/messaging applications are:
No hold times
Provides records of a chat
Easy to multitask
Can use it at work 
According to surveys users spends 10 minutes per day with the chat app on average. Then the idea of creating a chat application comes to my mind.
After some time I realized there are lots of kids(10-15) who use their parent's accounts to chat with their friends, so I decided to create a chat application for kids, which will be easy to use. I decide to keep this app as easy as possible. 
According to the internet, android is the most used operating system in the world, with over 2.5 billion android users So, therefore, I decided to create an android application.

1.2 Objectives:
This is a chat application so the main feature of this app is messaging. For secure communication, this app will be end-to-end encrypted which means third parties can not access data while it’s transferred from one end to another end. 
For Signing up, this app uses an email id, and while logging in, for user authentication it uses log in with Email and Password.
If I want people to install and use my app. I have to do something to make people trust my app. To make people trust my app I used a blue (hex code:#63eaf7) color for the app because according to color psychology blue color represents trust, according to color psychology humans trust the products which are blue in color therefore apps like Facebook, Twitter, hike, etc. use the blue color.        
It’s not good for kids to use chat application for long time that’s this app is putting some restriction on uses of the application.
This Chat application is for kids who are using their parent’s account to communicate with friends, this app will give kids privacy but with some small restrictions such as
If kid want to Sign Up or want to Sign In he/she can not Sign Up/Sign In in the absences of parent,application will first check that the user Signing Up /Signing In have any adult with him/her or not.   
While Signing Up you have to provide parent’s contact number.
If kid will use chat application continuously for 30 minutes the message will be send to the parent that “Your kid has been using a chat application since 30 minutes.”
App will be freezed between 12:00 am to 5:00 am (Sleep Time).


1.3 Purpose:
The main purpose of this project is to give kids privacy to their chats by giving them their own (specially created for them) chat application, and to give parents the confidence that their kids are not over using the application.
This app will inform parent that the kid is over using the phone. When kids are using parent’s account to chat both kids and parents can open each others chat by mistakenly ,so to solve this problem this app gives the kids his/her own account , privacy to chat,etc. parents can allow their kids to use the application without worrying about over use of phone. 

1.4 Scope :
This application is for kid so this application is very simple and it almost have same controls as majority of chat application have,so it will be very easy to use.
There are also few features which can be integrated:
Cartoons and Animations can be added to application to make chatting more enjoyable for kids.
Can add a feature to create a study group. 
We can also allow teachers to create account means  if kids want to communicate with teachers they can communicate.
We can also allow parents to create accounts.
We can give parents controls to freeze kids' account
Can add video calling feature for longer conversations.

1.5 Advantages:
Gives easy-to-use chat application to kids
Stop kids from overusing phones
Give kids privacy to communicate 
Faster chatting
To stop them using chat application during sleep time
